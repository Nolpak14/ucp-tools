Was about to fork the UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol) flow while exploring Shopify catalogs… then hit a wall 🙂

UCP on Shopify is currently limited to US and CA.

Still, this makes one thing very clear:
UCP isn’t just checkout. It’s a commerce feed built for AI.

Just like Merchant Center feeds power Google Shopping today,
UCP-like layers will power AI-led discovery and transactions tomorrow.

Brands with strong online reputation will benefit the most, because trust is what allows users to transact without fear.

Do you think users will trust AI-led, one-click transactions enough to skip brand websites altogether—or will visiting the site remain essential for trust?

IMO it can be trusted if the product catalogue is semantically rich for the AI models to interpret it correctly but most listings are far from this. The issue is in the nuances of the products and their variants, compounded by warranty conditions, product claims etc.

With respect to user trust. I’m seeing that user confidence in AI-mediated tasks is increasing as ChatGPT becomes a house hold name. This won’t be the blocker.

I build in this space.

Considering chatgpt is depended on ucp feed, it can show any products with better schema on users results?

Google shopping feed is much advance than this. I know space is new but consider a scenario

You search for a “smart watch” on UCP, it will show you many products from pool of feed.

Consumer will trust which one? Or ai will add a parameter to judge the “reputation” “domain authority” signal to protect the users from fraud.

IMO: Google is way more advance and UCP space is still emerging.

Since you build in the similar space… What do you think will be best usecase for the UCP?

Agree it’s composite. Trust won’t come from one signal like better schema or domain authority.

What will matter is: clean product/variant truth, verified merchants with good fulfillment and dispute history, and real recourse (easy cancel/refund). If the agent can show a short “why this pick” plus user prefs like “soft”, “authorized sellers only” etc people will skip sites more often. If any of those are weak, they’ll bounce back to the brand site or skip the product altogether.

UCP’s best use case for now is turning high-intent conversations into safe, structured transactions.

I’m still looking forward to see extension of UCP on Google merchant center to have all these basic reputation indicators already or can be available there.

Wait.. while replying here I just verified on https://developers.google.com/merchant/ucp/guides/merchant-center#21_agentic_checkout_eligibility

The US/CA limitation makes sense - they're testing with markets where AI shopping adoption is highest.

To your question about trust: I think it'll be hybrid. AI handles discovery and comparison, but users will still want to verify unfamiliar brands. The brands that win are ones with strong reviews, clear return policies, and established reputation that AI can surface.

The /.well-known/ucp endpoint is essentially your store's "resume" for AI agents - it tells them what you support (checkout, orders, fulfillment) and how to connect. Spec details at ucp.dev if you want to see the structure.

When Bots Become Customers: UCP's Identity Shift
Shopify General Discussion
TL;DR: Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) deprecates behavioral bot detection (mouse tracking, CAPTCHAs) in favor of cryptographic identity verification. The protocol includes strong security features - TAP for agent authentication, requires_escalation for human-in-the-loop, provable consent for payments. But adoption takes time. During the transition, merchants who implement UCP without its full security stack create a window of exposure.

Question about UCP and product data
Shopify General Discussion
So UCP will use our product data to create feeds that allow people to shop "off site" - and i understand that the better our product data, the better our feed will be. By giving extensive data about each product we give the AI a better understanding of our products.

My question is, how are we going to improve our product data? Shopify gives us very few tools to actual add this info to our rpoducts - basically you've got metafields and that's it. But how viable is it to have 50 metafields of product data ? and how will shopify be able to process this metafield data to know what it is and what it represents? will it use tags? how? Category Metafields (with their specific and limited number of options)?

First find out what type of data your feed can accept and how to do it. No point and adding 50 amazing metafields if the feed does not send them.

Shopify's Agentic Plan signals a future where store front ends are (mostly) irrelevant
Shopify General Discussion
https://www.shopify.com/agentic-plan

Lots of different takes on the Shopify / Google / UCP news today but I'd highlight the reality that if Shopify is offering a plan that is really only aimed at making Shopify a data feed, Shopify is seeing a future where brands won't be building front ends for their stores.

I recognize (for a while at least) most brands will continue to want and need their own .com to help tell and sell their story. BUT, there may come a day when your .com is mainly for customer support and has very little to do with your marketing and customer retention. (I know that some social first brands are already here).

There are plenty of us who are mainly B2B on Shopify that this doesn't really apply to at all. The vast majority of our sales are even still on desktop, to manufacturing shops who order from an office workstation. There is no reality (at least while I am still in the workforce) where these people shop from AI.

Most normal consumers won't want this anytime soon either. Who wants to give their CC info to an AI agent, "Hun, set up a vacation for me.... and no, I don't want to see any of the prices or things you've bought until after you've made payments on each and everything!"

99.5% of people will want to at least see at least some sort of final invoice (after tax, shipping, etc) before authorizing their purchases. This reminds me of when everybody thought Voice Search and Voice Shopping on smart speakers was the next big thing. Don't get me wrong, I have zero doubt AI is the next big thing (the small amount it's already improved my life/workload is insane) but these shifts take society a long time - especially feeling comfortable with something as potentially ruinous as non-deterministic software randomly pulling money out of your bank account.

In 2000, EVERYBODY knew ecommerce was the next big think and a huge portion of retails sales would be moving online (hence the dotcom boom). Here we are 26 long years later and only about 20% of total US retail transactions are done online - its even lower worldwide. People obviously enjoy making some purchases in person and many still aren't comfortable with purchasing things online. I know a lot of friends' parents weren't comfortable with it for a long time. I doubt our generation will be any different. I'm sure it will take a lot of us some time to fully trust AI to do things for us. Plus, people will always enjoy looking at product photos, reading reviews, shopping around, and doing research before buying something. I have no doubt AI will streamline a lot of this curation and info gathering (like google did for our gen) but that info still needs to come from somewhere... it may as well be your website. For the foreseeable future, most people will want to see a final price on a trustworthy store/platform before making the final yes/no decision.

In the UK it's quite a bit higher at 28% but I agree with the overall sentiment. No-one, especially for higher value goods, is going to relinquish control and decision making to a bot to purchase goods sight unseen; I agree the shift in mindset will take decades (if at all). I can see it if it's a very low value purchase "hey LLM bot, buy me some dog poo bags, don't spend more than £3".

How much of that hold out is grocery?

How much is restaurants?

How much is fuel?

Its kind of a stacked deck to say "ecommerce is only X" when you have categories that still are naturally quite resistant to online purchasing for a variety of reasons.

I'd also point out that what is being missed- these aren't unled agents. This is you Google searching products, being prompted to ask follow ups (or asking your own), until you are satisfied with the selection and make the purchase.

Agentic is badly abused and the reality was the use case of some AI running amok planning my trip was never the thing that got widely adopted. This is just Google search bringing data from ecommerce sites to the search-AI experience and a user buying IN Google.

Again, this is just going to be planted inside of Google Search.

How many of your site visitors come through Google Search?

The power of Google vs. ChatGPT in the AI experience is that it doesn't require consumers switching to something new- they get switched.

Right now it is in Google AI Mode, but there is good reason to believe that AI Mode experiences will be mainstreamed this year.

So your desktop users will go to Google, type in the model # or part # of what they're looking for and the Shopify shop who has a decent price and checkout through Google is the one that gets the transaction.

Sure, bigger B2B ops that require buyer approvals and the ilk might be resistant but even their buyers Google.

And to the final point- they won't think of it as buying from AI- they're buying on Google.

Ours do not, but you are correct in that many do. Our buyers are on our site for less than a minute, and our biggest new customer outreach is via direct outside sales reps, on the road, visiting shops. When our customers come to our site it is to order quickly, get a product download (like a safety data sheet), watch a tutorial or product demo video, or similar. The vast majority of our site visitors come from direct visits, not search engines. But I realize we are an outlier than many ecom stores.

The main point of my original comment was to show that not all ecom stores are the same, and not all fit into such programs. We are all diffferent sellers, indeed.

There was a time when the same horror stories were told about Amazon. And for a section of vendors there were trrue.

I believe there is a fit for certain products that are easier sold via a AI chat than on a sub-par shop, but for serious brands with a good shop experience I see this just as another fad.

This doesn't require hype. I'm not promising AI do something new and novel.

Just that it takes over basic experiences.

Something it is already doing.

Further, consumers don't get much say in the matter, as evidenced by the AI bots being shoved into every nook and cranny of every app and software you use.

Google, with UCP, is basically taking the shopping highway of search and changing its destination to their checkout instead of ours. Merchants assume that they'll get some say in things but when has Google ever been responsive to them?

If you were comparable shopping Google shopping is so much better right now

If you were brand shopping you would just go to their site why limit yourself to a Chat interface

That is exactly what is significant about this particular announcement.

Google is pushing AI Mode (a variation on Google search and its likely next evolution) to end in these checkout experiences.

Shopify makes mention of ChatGPT because its ChatGPT, but the real thing to pay attention to is Google's switch from traditional search to AI first search.

Not really, because googles AI like everyone else’s isn’t actually AI just an algorithm that is no different to googles current search except it kills more trees.

Google AI is window dressing for their summary box they already had, with AI in its name to show the average consumer they are “keeping up with the times”

Google shopping is already “AI”, the best search results for that particular user (accounting for maximising googles revenue) - under the hood they won’t change what already works

Most Shopify owners are already ensuring product options land in their feed data, which means that data is going to be available to the 'agent'.

For stores with lots of complexity and customized product configurators, this will be a challenge and they'll need to either be boxed out, or rework their product setup to have a simpler 'entrant' into the agentic experience that can be used to bait AI customers into further personalization.

I'd envision a flow where someone buys the base product through UCP, then engages with the merchant directly for additional personalization/customization at an add on price.

On the basis of what...?

The web as we know it is highly dependent on search to act as the defacto portal for accessing new and existing content. If that whole set of rails moves into these AI experiences, you don't get any say in the matter.

If you're a developer (like many of our team members), you have to start thinking about how you fit in that evolving ecosystem.

This is a great insight. You’re right of a couple of things.

I am working with customers with easy inventory and my data augmentation services are comprehensive and mainly used to validate product claims and improve product matchmaking which reduces returns and increase customer review ratings. However, one of my customers has north of 100k product items. The level of complexity in their inventory is pretty massive and sometimes the differences between product variants are very nuanced.

AI can be really helpful for this kind of customer. With the right level of context engineering and data feed, my customer is able to better explain product differentiation, variant overlap and exclusions etc.

The baiting part is a dangerous. We find that when buyers shown incorrect information (eg something as simple as inventory quantity) is fairly detrimental to the experience. Buyers have less patience with misleading or incorrect data in AI- assisted workflows.

We're primarily an SEO agency, so we've been pretty hard at work optimizing our clients for AI search rankings (or prompt response rankings) in parallel to our efforts with Google. What is interesting is that Google is leading the way here not, ChatGPT.

Shopify is specifically recommending using the knowledge base app as one of the supplemental apps to help with building out your AI agent content.

I'd look at your clients who have problematic product options and configurations. They're already a pain to setup on Shopify (natively) so are likely to encounter some issues with how the shopping experience is reflected in AI shopping and discovery. We're working with some of our GEO clients to build out base products that allow for post-purchase customization or configuration as a trial in advance of the end of January.

Are you grouping via meta objects? We have a couple with maybe 8000 skus that could benefit, but our main client atm has about 100 products that are nicely set up, but we’d planned to work on the collections (not so greatly set up). Thought aligning this would be a good move, perhaps.

I don’t think that’s the case. Whilst people are using LLMs and purchases will be made through them, there will still be a demand for a storefront.

Shopify is taking advantage of the multi channel nature in which people shop these days.

Having a blog on your website that is parsed by LLMs and then populated in results in AI searches is likely a strategy that many businesses are taking advantage of at the moment. Which represents the need to still have a front end.

The challenges to that will be-

As soon as an LLM detects transactional intent, it can be steered to surfacing transactional/shoppable content. Google and OpenAI have already indicated that purchasable products will likely receive prioritization in prompt responses. That means (a) you're likely to see blog content be less relevant for prompt response ranking in shopping intents, and (b) likely to see brands who have opted in/stayed opted in more prominently positioned.

I do think multi-channel shopping will persist for a while, but LLMs are already trying to squeeze out unnecessary app experiences. Remember that Meta announced public content would be indexable by Google and others- that means you could easily start to see LLMs used to surface all manners of content we jump into different apps or sites for today.


-------------------------------------------------------


shopify just turned every AI into a sales channel (ChatGPT, Gemini & Co-pilot)
Shopify General Discussion
shopify built Universal Commerce Protocol with google. its an open standard that lets AI agents complete full checkout not just recommendations.

customers ask chatgpt or gemini for a product AI handles the entire purchase right there. discount codes loyalty payment everything. one conversation start to finish.

Shopify merchants sell directly inside:

- google AI mode & gemini

- microsoft copilot

- chatgpt

all managed from one place in shopify admin. set it up once works everywhere.

UCP is a standard not a custom integration. build once scales everywhere. handles every checkout flow subscriptions delivery selection loyalty final sale confirmations.

over 20 retailers endorsed it. google backing it. this becomes THE standard.

monos gymshark everlane selling in google AI mode soon. keen pura vida kyte baby using copilot checkout already.

early movers own the channel. late adopters fight for scraps.

new agentic plan lets ANY brand on ANY platform list products in shopify catalog and sell through all these AI channels.
dont need a shopify store. connect your catalog once get access to chatgpt copilot google AI gemini shop app everything.

Shopify merchants: set up agentic storefronts now. test copilot checkout if eligible. think about discovery in AI conversations not just google search.

Non-shopify brands: look into agentic plan. get product data clean. this train is leaving.

agentic commerce is the platform shift. conversation to checkout in seconds. shopify built the rails and opened it to everyone.

brands moving fast own the next decade. ones waiting lose badly.

the gap between early and late on this will be brutal. like mobile-first vs mobile-eventually all over again.

It's not like that. If your store is not ready for "Embedded AI Commerce". It will only bring problems. Many stores lack the data integrity and cohesion for any sort of crawler to properly understand what they do. If they activate this, it will only return as increased amount of chargebacks and refunds.

json-ld is important yes. The more your products are aligned with schemas, the easier for them to be crawled and understand by ai crawlers.

The important thing here is that most ai crawlers are quite primitive compared to the Google's crawlers. if your content is behind javascript, there is a very high chance that it's invisible.

But shopify handles store information quite nicely actually. Shopify is actually doing really good job on programatically exposing the store information. There are 2 things that has issues with Shopify:

Shopify controls when and how the crawlers will visit shopify stores to reduce their infrastructure cost. So as an individual store you don't have much influence on this. (unless you are on your own custom store and use headless shopify) And tbh it's fine. you don't need to deal with this.

The main issue is: many stores suffer from subpar content. Shopify is good at exposing your store to ai and other crawlers, but it can only expose what you have on your storefront. If your store content and products are not optimized for SEO and AI crawlers, shopify will expose that mess. And it will make things actually worse. Now the ai crawlers can easily hallucinate on your store information. Because they don't know what you do but there is an easy access.

If your store content is scattered all over the place, if there are contradictory information, if the content that is specific to your niche are hard to find in the store and not properly optimized, if your internal linking have problems, so basically if your store is not tidy. the shopify will programmatically expose all this mess to crawlers. they will come, they will pick that mess up, and once they get confuse they will start hallucinating.

Last but not least, what i say doesn't mean: "optimize your store for crawlers". Quite the contrary. Focus on people, your customers. Make sure your store is good for them. Then fix the schemas based on that. AI is trained to be like humans. The ai optimization is all about helping them to do their jobs. they pretend to be like humans but they are still way behind. They just can't fill the gaps like people do. you should fill that gap in your content and structure.

gotcha! fully understand the js part, however i think most webshop vendors offer server side rendering to accommodate crawlers. for the other part, spot on, you can try to structure the mess, but it will still be a mess...

The pitch is that these bots can just *do* the whole buying process but I really wonder how they'll work when the choice appears at checkout for shipping. Unless the buyer sees the shipping options in the AI interface, that's the one thing that isn't nor couldn't be perfectly standardized like the rest of the ecommerce experience. Merchants' shipping options differ store to store, region to region and it get's weirder when the goods are anything larger than a parcel and require extra handling instructions.

Yes the buying process will get disrupted by AI, but I think you're overestimating how fast consumers will adapt. This is a huge behaviour shift for the average consumer. The large majority of people still aren’t using AI regularly (or even know how). We're still in the “early home computer” era of AI, aka the technology exists but first we need to overcome a huge learning curve. Consumer behaviour change will take YEARS.

I build in this space.

Consumer behaviour is already changing. I constantly talk to customers who are losing sales bc shoppers search for products semantically (instead of keyword matching). Then, the next problem is cart abandonment because product search results aren’t personalized to the user (unlike answers by Answer engines).

The influence of ChatGPT in our everyday lives can’t be understated.

The biggest challenge to adoption is the lack of product semantics to guarantee a good result match.

No body wants this. BigCartel allows businesses to opt out of AI and protects them from AI scraping. Maybe consider this approach instead of the "scrape now, deal with the backlash later" approach before we all start to jump ship.

The AI Chargeback Apocalypse
Shopify General Discussion
Shopify has released support for AI agents making purchases from your store.

https://www.shopify.com/news/ai-commerce-at-scale

If you think 25% chargeback rates from Amazon "Buy for Me" was bad, well just read this:

With UCP, agents can natively complete checkout on a customer’s behalf

Super, but Shopify must have made this opt in, right? Nope. From the sales channel settings page:

The global Shopify Catalog is your launchpad for AI shopping. It automatically uses your default product listing, no setup required.

and

Agentic Storefronts will be automatically enabled in your store

For what it's worth, I had an extremely high chargeback/fraud rate with Amazon Buy For Me, but we actually do well with ChatGPT traffic, it performs similarly to organic Google traffic (at a much smaller scale). I think the difference is Amazon customers are not my customers, and Amazon's policies promote bad behaviors. Whereas someone asking ChatGPT about comparisons among my product categories is a serious person considering a real purchase. I've had at least one person experiencing some form of LLM delusion, and that was weird, but so far, it's mostly normies.

Before this Shopify AI program, I had planned to structure and standardize more of my product data for LLMs (and better product page templates), and I still plan on doing that. To date, proper SEO practices and lots of public store reviews seem to help us the most with being top of "mind" for LLMs.

100% this. Someone asking ChatGPT where to buy X product and completing transaction within that chat is completely different to an Amazon customer buying your products through Amazons own marketplace without you listing on there.

SEO Best practices definitely helps. Especially schema and EEAT work helps AI crawlers as well. One interesting test you can try and check if it increases your AI referrals is that keep updating your top 10 products before big events, sales occasions etc.

AI crawlers have a strong recency bias and they like fresher and newly updated content. Especially on the ecommerce side.

I got the email and am trying to figure out where the fees might be viewed, and more importantly how to opt out.

I'm not a fan of any AI, and resistant to integration. I'm sure this will be useful for some storefront sales, but as a brick and mortar with less than 1% of sales online, I find the whole thing disturbing.

That’s why stores shouldn’t activate this if their store data is not optimized. You should first make sure ai can understand your store perfectly.

I will be turning it off as soon as this shows up in my admin side. The fact that Shopify is automatically doing this without us making the choice to opt in is BS. It makes it feel like we don’t own our own websites. Might as well be on Etsy if Shopify does stuff like this!

------------------------------------------------------


Technical Guide: How to fix the "Missing field 'hasMerchantReturnPolicy'" error (New Jan 2026 UCP Standards)
Marketing
Hey everyone,

If you monitor Google Merchant Center (GMC) or Search Console, you may have noticed a spike in "Red" warnings over the last 48 hours: Missing field "hasMerchantReturnPolicy" Missing field "shippingDetails"

I spent the last two days analyzing the new Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) documentation to understand why this is happening now, and I wanted to share the technical breakdown and the fix.

The Root Cause: Agentic Commerce Google officially began enforcing UCP standards on January 11, 2026. This is the framework designed for "Agentic Commerce"—allowing AI Agents (like Gemini or ChatGPT) to transact on behalf of users.

To do this, Agents need a structured "Contract of Sale." Most Shopify, WooCommerce, and custom themes currently generate "Simple" Product Schema (just Name, Image, Price). They fail to inject the nested MerchantReturnPolicy object inside the Offer.

Without this nested object, your products are essentially invisible to AI shopping agents, and Google is downgrading the listings in Rich Results.

The Technical Fix (Manual) You cannot fix this by just writing text on your shipping policy page. You must inject a specific JSON-LD block into your <head>.

Here is the valid structure Google is looking for (you can add this to your theme.liquid or functions.php):

JSON

"offers": {
  "@type": "Offer",
  "price": "100.00",
  "priceCurrency": "USD",
  "hasMerchantReturnPolicy": {
    "@type": "MerchantReturnPolicy",
    "applicableCountry": "US",
    "returnPolicyCategory": "https://schema.org/MerchantReturnFiniteReturnWindow",
    "merchantReturnDays": 30,
    "returnFees": "https://schema.org/ReturnShippingFees"
  }
}
Important: You must map applicableCountry using the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (e.g., "US", "GB"). If you omit this, the validator will still throw a warning.

The Automated Solution If you aren't comfortable editing theme files manually, or if you have complex return logic (e.g., different policies for different collections), I built a validator tool to handle this.

It uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to scan your live product page, extract your specific natural language return rules, and generate the exact validated JSON-LD code (Liquid or PHP) to patch your store globally.

It’s a one-time license (no monthly subscription) because I don't believe you should pay rent for a code fix.

You can run a free compliance scan on your URL here:https://websiteaiscore.com/ucp-compliance-generator

I’ll be hanging around the comments for a few hours—happy to answer any technical questions about the schema implementation or the UCP update!
